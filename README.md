Blog

This is a very simple blog application written in procedural PHP.

I haven't used PHP since university (recently I have used Ruby on Rails) so I made this as a lesson to myself.

At the moment these are the features:

* Users can register
* Users can login
* Registration and login forms perform correct validation
* Users can write posts
* Users can delete their own posts
* Users are prevented from deleting the posts of others

Here are some features that I should probably implement:

* Pagination on the home page (currently it will display ALL posts on the home page)
* Some sort of admin section where you can manage users
* Edit posts
* Session timeouts
